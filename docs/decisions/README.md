# Design Decisions Archive

**Purpose:** Preserve the reasoning behind significant design choices.

## What This Folder Contains

When building Nexus Dominion, we evaluated multiple approaches for key systems. This folder preserves alternative designs that were considered but not chosen, along with the rationale.

**Why keep these?**
- Future designers can understand why current systems work the way they do
- Ideas may become relevant as the game evolves
- Prevents re-debating settled decisions

## How to Use This Folder

### When Adding New Decisions

1. Create markdown file with clear title
2. Include sections:
   - **Concept**: What was proposed
   - **Why Considered**: The appeal of this approach
   - **Why Not Chosen**: Trade-offs that led to rejection
   - **Potential Future Use**: When this might become relevant

### When Reviewing Past Decisions

Before proposing a change to core systems:
1. Check if the alternative was already considered
2. Understand the original reasoning
3. Identify what has changed that might shift the decision
