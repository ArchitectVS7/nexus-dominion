## Usage

Generate analysis for a system:
```bash
/spec-analyze COMBAT
```

After all systems are analyzed, run verification:
```bash
# Build complete dependency graph
# (To be implemented)
```

## File Format

Each `{SYSTEM}-deps.json` contains:
- `system`: System name
- `analyzedAt`: Timestamp
- `totalSpecs`: Number of specs analyzed
- `specs`: Object with each spec's dependencies and blockers
- `summary`: Aggregated statistics
