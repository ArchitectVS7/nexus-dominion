## The Goal for January

Nexus Dominion to be playable end-to-end. Here's what alpha testers can experience:

### Core Gameplay Loop

- **Turn-based empire management** - Build your empire over 50-500 turns
- **10-100 AI opponents** - Dynamic bot personalities compete for dominance
- **6 victory conditions** - Conquest, Economic, Diplomatic, Research, Military, Survival (selectable by game mode? 6 victory conditions seems excessive for normal play)
- **D20 combat** - Using the 3.5 OGL from Wizards of the Coast, taking inspiration from d20 era games such as Star Wars Miniatures and d20 Star Wars RPG, utilizing as much of the d20 system as possible, including military stats and bot personas

### Empire Management

- **X resource types** - Credits, Food, Etc
- **X sector types** - Each producing different resources
- **X unit types** - From soldiers to heavy cruisers and defense stations
- **Civil status system** - Empire happiness affects income multipliers

**DEV NOTE** - We used to have a legacy document that laid out all the game mechanics of the classic solar realms elite. That game ended up being more of a dead weight than anything, only thriving as a game due to the limited and assymetrical nature of BBS gaming. The system was far too mathmatical and algirithmic. Gameplay was more like "managing a spreadsheet" than "building an empire". As part of our redesign to be our own thing, we are making deliberate efforts to not only shift our terminology but looking mathematically at our combat system, econimic sytsrem, ratios, etc. Keep this in mind as we make our game systems, and let's not be tied down to this.

### Bot AI System

- **4-tier intelligence** - From LLM-powered elite bots to simple rule-followers
- **8 archetypes** - Warlord, Diplomat, Merchant, Schemer, Turtle, Blitzkrieg, Tech Rush, Opportunist
- **Emotional states** - Bots remember relationships and hold grudges
- **100 unique personas** - Each with distinct voice and behavior. Bots are unique based on their strategic choices and narrative trees. In addition, upong game initialization, it has been discussed to vary key weights by X% across all bots, giving each game a slight unique feel every game. 

### User Interface

- **LCARS-inspired design** - Star Trek aesthetic with modern polish
- **Starmap command center** - Geographic strategy with sector connections
- **Progressive disclosure** - UI complexity grows as you learn
- **Tutorial system** - 5-step guided onboarding

## Alpha Tester Focus Areas

We need feedback on:

1. **First-time experience** - Can you figure out what to do?
2. **Bot personality** - Do opponents feel distinct and readable?
3. **Combat balance** - Are battles exciting without being random?
4. **Turn pacing** - Does the game flow well?
5. **Victory paths** - Are all 6 victory conditions viable?
